### What I learned

I reinforced some concepts that I never had to implement on my own before. Remembering that changing the body background color was my, "Oh your are an idiot moment."  I struggled initially with centering the content. I did a fair amount of googling. Learned more about flexboxes.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-text">
    <h5>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h3>
      <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
```css
body{
background-color:hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
text-align: center;
margin:20% 5% 5% 5%;
display:flex;
flex-direction:column;
align-items: center;
min-height:100vh;
justify-content: center;
}

```


### Continued development

Still work on the basics of html and css. Need to get more comfortable with flex boxes, padding and margins.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
